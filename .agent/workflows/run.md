To run the AI Crop Advisory system, follow these steps:

1. **Open a terminal** in the root directory: `c:\Users\tanvi\OneDrive\Documents\ai_crop_advisory`
2. **Start the server**:
   ```powershell
   node server.js
   ```
3. **Access the application**: 
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> [!NOTE]
> The server is currently already running from my previous verification step, so you can likely just open the link right now!
